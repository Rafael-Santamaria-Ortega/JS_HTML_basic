# JavaScript Code Challenges

This repository contains a JavaScript code challenge from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/javascriptbasics) that demonstrates various JavaScript concepts, including variables, objects, arrays, loops, and sorting. It also includes an HTML file to display the output in a web browser.

## Features

- Demonstrates JavaScript variable types (`var`, `let`, `const`)
- Uses objects and arrays
- Implements `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops
- Performs basic DOM manipulation using `document.write()`
- Sorts an array using JavaScript's `.sort()` method
- Styled with a black background and green monospace text

## File Structure

```
.
├── code_challenges.js  # JavaScript file with the challenges
└── index.html          # HTML file to display output
```

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/js-code-challenges.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd js-code-challenges
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser:
   ```sh
   open index.html  # MacOS
   start index.html # Windows
   ```
   Or simply double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default browser.

## Preview

The webpage features:
- A **black background** with **green** text for a retro-style terminal look.
- Output from JavaScript functions directly displayed in the browser.
- Console logs available in the browser's developer tools (`F12` → Console).

## Example Output

When you run the project, you should see:
- **Neo's pill choice** displayed
- A **character from Mr. Robot**
- **Number sequences** from different loops
- **An array before and after sorting**
